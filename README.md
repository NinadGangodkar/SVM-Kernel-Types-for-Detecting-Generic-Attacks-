Generic network intrusion attacks are those that don't fit conventional categories, making them challenging to detect. This project aims to enhance cloud network security by extracting essential features from the UNSW-NB15 dataset using particle swarm optimization. Support vector machine models with various kernel functions are trained on a balanced dataset and evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. Results indicate that the radial basis function SVM kernel is most effective in identifying both known and unknown generic attacks, offering promising avenues for improving network security.
